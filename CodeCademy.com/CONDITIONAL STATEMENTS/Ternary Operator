/*In the spirit of using short - hand syntax, we can use a ternary operator to simplify an if...else statement.

Take a look at the if...else statement example:

let isNightTime = true;

if (isNightTime) {
    console.log('Turn on the lights!');
} else {
    console.log('Turn off the lights!');
}
We can use a ternary operator to perform the same functionality:

isNightTime ? console.log('Turn on the lights!') : console.log('Turn off the lights!');
In the example above:

The condition, isNightTime, is provided before the?.
Two expressions follow the ? and are separated by a colon:.
If the condition evaluates to true, the first expression executes.
If the condition evaluates to false, the second expression executes.
Like if...else statements, ternary operators can be used for conditions which evaluate to true or false.*/
