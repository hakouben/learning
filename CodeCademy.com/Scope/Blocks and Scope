Blocks and Scope
Before we talk more about scope, we first need to talk about blocks.

We’ve seen blocks used before in functions and if statements. A block is the code found inside a set of curly braces {}. Blocks help us group one or more statements together and serve as an important structural marker for our code.

A block of code could be a function, like this:

const logSkyColor = () => {
  let color = 'blue'; 
  console.log(color); // blue 
}
Notice that the function body is actually a block of code.

Observe the block in an if statement:

if (dusk) {
  let color = 'pink';
  console.log(color); // pink
}
In the next few exercises, we’ll see how blocks define the scope of variables.
