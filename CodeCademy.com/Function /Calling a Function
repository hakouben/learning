As we saw in previous exercises, a function declaration binds a function to an identifier.

However, a function declaration does not ask the code inside the function body to run, it just declares the existence of the function. The code inside a function body runs, or executes, only when the function is called.

To call a function in your code, you type the function name followed by parentheses.


            greetWorld();

            This function call executes the function body, or all of the statements between the curly braces in the function declaration.

    1 function getGreeting(){
        3  console.log('Hello , world ');
    }

   2 getGreeting();
   //4 code after function call 

   We can call the same function as many times as needed.

Letâ€™s practice calling functions in our code.
